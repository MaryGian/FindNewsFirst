# FindNewsFirst
This is a console aplication written in java. This aplication gives users the article information of their choice either from only top-headlines articles or
from a variaty of articles, blogs etc.
It is a maven project so all the necessary libraries are automatically installed when you build your project.
The only thing you need to do is download the files from FindNewsFirstLibrary repository and put it in your local maven repository. 
FindNewsFirstLibrary is a library written by me.
My library uses NewsApi and Abstract API so be sure you have the necessary api-keys for using this library.
There are instructions at the read me note on that repository.

Any further explanation is not need it as the program will guide you step by step.
